## IMPORTANT NOTICE

AI went live on 1. Sept 2016. Make sure that `:balloon: AI History starts here`
is on your `master` branch so that the `./bin/maintenance` auto-update integration
works fine. Otherwise re-fork your fork or force-pull from upstream.


## Work-in-Progress (aka alpha)

These are the things that we are currently working on:

- lychee.ai.neat (ES/HyperNEAT AI) is being refactored and unstable (`feature/neat` branch).
- lychee.net.protocol.MQTT is being implemented to support SCADA systems (`feature/mqtt` branch).
- lychee.js Guide is subject to change (to integrate new AI stack).


## ELI5 - What is lychee.js?

Okay. First it was a Game / App Engine that had the idea to reuse components
across all environments ([Fertilizer Adapters]()) with a strong core definition
system that allowed feature detection and automated isomorphic builds (one code
to rule them all).

Then it got a strong serialization / deserialization concept that allowed
simulations across all platforms. Errors could be reproduced everywhere, even
network traffic and user interactions were put in event graphs and identified
by neural networks to figure out what module (in the flow-based-programming
sense) had corrupt data.

Then it got an evolutionary [lychee.ai](./libraries/lychee/source/ai) Stack
(backpropagated ES/HyperNEAT) that allows an AI to learn combinations of all
Definitions using a Module Pattern or Composite Pattern. Class Pattern failed,
because Classes are a time abstraction so they suck in complexity. Deal with it :)

Then it got a generic plug/play neural network support; so that the [lychee.policy](./libraries/lychee/source/policy)
Stack allowed to generically translate _every property_ in all Composites into
what neural networks can understand. As everything in lychee.js is serializable
and uses a Composite Pattern, things like traffic sharding, automated layouting
or animation learning and debugging of it got inclusive.

Then the knowledge graph was reused to build a better fuzz-testing tool, the
[lychee.js Breeder](./libraries/breeder), using some kind of tree that is similar
to a multi-dimensional-quad-tree to identify similar data and behaviour for more
efficient ANN testing and evaluation.

Then the [lychee.js Harvester](./libraries/harvester) got a peer-to-peer network
infrastructure that allowed to share all knowledge graphs across the internet.
That means every single lychee.js Project on planet Earth contributes to an AI
learning how to build software and therefore helps auto-improving all written
code that depends on each other (using fuzz tests, flow graph tests and above
Composite idea) for evaluation of newly designed Composites.

Then the [lychee.js Studio](./libraries/studio) was built, trying to use above
suggestions so that developers have some kind of "Zen Coding"-like autocompletion
for Definitions they want to build, leveraging the first intelligent auto-complete
using bayesian reinforced learning.

Oh, and it can compile, analyze, bugfix and improve itself, too. That's essentially
what the [./bin/configure.sh](./bin/configure.sh) script does when it builds and
distributes the lychee.js Library.

Then I thought well, I guess I'm mad - and have no idea how to explain what this
Engine has gotten to be. - @cookiengineer

## Features

The lychee.js Engine aims to deliver Total Automation through
Artificial Intelligence and better Software Architecture.

Everything listed here requires zero lines of code overhead
and is already fully integrated in the [lychee.js Boilerplate](./projects/boilerplate):

The lychee.js Core and Definition System ([lychee](/libraries/lychee) and [legacy](/libraries/legacy)):

- Isomorphic Application Engine (runs pretty much everywhere)
- Language is only ES5/ES6 JavaScript Code, nothing else
- Composite Pattern inspired Entity/Component System
- Definition System embraces Simplicity and Feature Detection
- Sandboxing System embraces automated Error Reports, Analytics and Debugging
- Serialization System allows Re-Simulation on any Platform
- Built-In Offline Storage Management and Network Synchronization

The lychee.js Software Bots:

- Graphical Asset Management and Entity/Scene Design Tool ([Studio](/libraries/studio))
- Graphical Project Management and Server Maintenance Tool ([Ranger](/libraries/ranger))
- Command-Line Continous Integration Server ([Harvester](/libraries/harvester))
- Command-Line Wizard for Projects and Libraries ([Breeder](/libraries/breeder))
- Command-Line Builder and Cross-Compiler ([Fertilizer](/libraries/fertilizer))
- Command-Line Fuzz-Tester and Code-Refactorer ([Strainer](/libraries/strainer))

## Platform / Fertilizer Support

The target platforms are described as so-called Fertilizers.
Those Fertilizers cross-compile everything automagically
using a serialized `lychee.Environment` that is setup in
each project's or library's `lychee.pkg` file.


| Target       | Fertilizer                   | Package   | armv7 |  x86  | x86\_64 |
|:-------------|:-----------------------------|:----------|:-----:|:-----:|:-------:|
| Browser      | html                         | zip, html |   x   |   x   |    x    |
| GNU/Linux    | html-nwjs, node, node-sdl    | bin       |   x   |   x   |    x    |
| OSX          | html-nwjs, node, node-sdl    | app, bin  |       |       |    x    |
| Windows      | html-nwjs, node, node-sdl    | exe       |       |   x   |    x    |
| Android      | html-webview, node, node-sdl | apk, bin  |   x   |   x   |    x    |
| BlackberryOS | html-webview, node, node-sdl | apk, bin  |   x   |   x   |    x    |
| FirefoxOS    | html-webview                 | zip       |   x   |   x   |    x    |
| iOS          | html                         |           |   x   |       |         |
| Ubuntu Touch | html-webview, node           | deb, bin  |   x   |   x   |    x    |

The iOS Fertilizer has currently no support for cross-compilation
due to XCode's gcc limitations. You can still create an own WebView
iOS App and use the `html` platform adapter.
